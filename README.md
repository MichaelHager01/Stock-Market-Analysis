# Stock-Market-Analysis
My team is developing a stock market prediction app using Tkinter in Python utilizing TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to implement neural networks and linear regression models. The goal of this project is to achieve accurate stock market predictions through comprehensive data analysis and model optimization techniques.

The jupyter file above provides the base code we will be using for the project. Our team aims to incrementally improve the model. Updates to the code will not be updated on GitHub.

Another task at hand for this project is to build an app in Python using Tkinter to make the use of the stock prediction more user-friendly. The code for the app will be posted and updated on GitHub.
